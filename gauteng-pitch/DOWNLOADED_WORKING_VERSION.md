# ✅ DOWNLOADED WORKING VERSION FROM GITHUB PAGES

## What I Did

1. ✅ Downloaded the **working** presentation from: https://bakiel.github.io/UAEI-Investment-Presentation/gauteng-pitch/
2. ✅ Backed up broken local files (*.broken-backup)
3. ✅ Replaced with working downloaded files
4. ✅ Deleted all test/debug files we created
5. ✅ Cleaned up reveal.js framework

## Files Now Active

- `index.html` - Downloaded working version (24 slides)
- `styles.css` - Downloaded working CSS
- `app.js` - Downloaded working JavaScript
- `image-integration.css` - Already present locally

## Open This:

**http://localhost:8888/index.html**

OR

Hard refresh in browser: **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows)

## What You Should See:

✅ 24 slides total
✅ Slide 1: TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION with logo
✅ Proper fonts and sizing
✅ All content visible
✅ Navigation working

## If Still Having Issues:

The downloaded version works on GitHub Pages, so if it doesn't work locally:

1. Check browser cache - do hard refresh
2. Check if images folder exists at `../assets/`
3. Check if illustrations folder has SVGs
4. Try different browser

## Backups Created:

- `index.html.broken-backup`
- `styles.css.broken-backup`
- `app.js.broken-backup`

## Deleted (Cleanup):

- NEW_PRESENTATION.html
- index-fixed.html

- emergency-fixes.css
- force-visibility.css
- fix-all-issues.js
- diagnostic.html
- simple-test.html
- reveal-framework/ (entire folder)
- All .md instruction files

## Next Steps:

1. Open the presentation
2. Test all 24 slides
3. If working, tell me what needs to be fixed/changed
4. If not working, we'll debug from the working GitHub version
