# 16:9 Landscape Audit

## Slides That Need Redesign:

1. **Slide 3: Failure Cycle** - Vertical flow, needs horizontal
2. **Slide 6: R250k Loan Package** - 3-column grid of 6 items = too tall
3. **Slide 11: Platform Architecture** - 4 vertical boxes = too tall
4. **Slide 12: Revenue Streams** - 3x2 grid might overflow
5. **Slide 14: Risk Management** - 2x2 grid of verbose cards
6. **Slide 17: Success Criteria** - 3x2 grid of cards
7. **Slide 18: The Ask** - 2-column but might be too tall

## Redesign Strategy:
- Use 2-column layouts (50/50 split)
- Put visual content on one side, text on other
- Reduce all vertical spacing by 50%
- Use horizontal grids (1 row x many columns)
- Eliminate illustrations that add vertical height
